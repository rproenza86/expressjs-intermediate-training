## Overview

Good news for JavaScript developers: Using Node.js and Express, you can build a web API to push and pull data from your applications via HTTP.

You don't have to learn ASP.NET or Python. You don't even have to know that much about back-end programming. In this training, I touched how to create a simple, RESTful web API with these two popular JavaScript libraries.

I have gone from how to set up the project, including the Express server and testing environment, and create the endpoints needed to add, update, and delete data from a MongoDB database. Finally I trained how to serve static files such as images with your new API, and explores additional libraries that can help streamline API development, such as [Koa](https://koajs.com), [Swagger](https://swagger.io) and [LoopBack](https://loopback.io).

## Objectives

- Setting up a project and a server
